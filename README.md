1. Caesar Cipher Encryption and Decryption

This Python script implements the Caesar cipher algorithm, an ancient encryption technique used by Julius Caesar to secure his confidential messages. The cipher encrypts and decrypts text by shifting letters in the alphabet by a fixed key. This implementation allows users to choose between encryption and decryption modes, input their desired shift key, and enter the message they want to process.

Features:

Encryption: Shifts letters in the alphabet by the specified key to encrypt the message.
Decryption: Shifts letters in the opposite direction to decrypt an encrypted message back to its original form.
Input Validation: Ensures that only alphabetical characters are shifted, leaving special characters and numbers unchanged.
User-Friendly Interface: Guides users through the encryption or decryption process with clear prompts and instructions.
Usage:

Encryption: Protect sensitive information by encrypting messages before transmission.
Decryption: Decrypt received messages that were encrypted using the Caesar cipher.
How to Use:

Choose whether to encrypt or decrypt a message.
Enter the shift key (0 to 25) to determine the degree of encryption or decryption.
Input the message to be encrypted or decrypted.
Receive the processed message and share it securely!
Feel free to experiment with different shift keys and messages to explore the power of the Caesar cipher encryption.
